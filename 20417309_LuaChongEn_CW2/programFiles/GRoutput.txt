Greedy Route - Dijkstra Algorithm

----------------------------------

Details of Greedy Route
1. Waste at location must be >=30% to be visited and collected
2. There is NO distance restriction for the location to be visited
3. Time taken must be within 8 hours, or else location will not be visited

Current Waste Levels: 
Waste at Location 1: 88%
Waste at Location 2: 0%
Waste at Location 3: 69%
Waste at Location 4: 76%
Waste at Location 5: 80%
Waste at Location 6: 55%
Waste at Location 7: 21%
Waste in KG at Location 1: 440kg
Waste in KG at Location 2: 0kg
Waste in KG at Location 3: 345kg
Waste in KG at Location 4: 380kg
Waste in KG at Location 5: 400kg
Waste in KG at Location 6: 275kg
Waste in KG at Location 7: 105kg

Shortest Path from Waste Station to each location:
Waste Station to Location 1: 3 km	Path: Waste Station -> Location 1
Waste Station to Location 3: 9 km	Path: Waste Station -> Location 1 -> Location 3
Waste Station to Location 4: 11 km	Path: Waste Station -> Location 1 -> Location 3 -> Location 4
Waste Station to Location 5: 14 km	Path: Waste Station -> Location 7 -> Location 6 -> Location 5
Waste Station to Location 6: 7 km	Path: Waste Station -> Location 7 -> Location 6

**Total time exceeds 8 hours, refer to the locations below that can be visited within 8 hours**

Locations that can be visited within 8 hours:
Location 1
Location 3
Location 4
Location 5

Driver Wage for this trip: 160 MYR

Total Distance for Visited Locations: 44 km
Total Cost: 110 MYR
Total Time: 8.8 hours
Total Fuel Consumption: 88 Liters
Cumulative total percentage of waste collected from all valid locations: 368%
Total Waste Collected: 1565kg
